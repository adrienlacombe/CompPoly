# `GF(2^64)` in a polynomial basis, and its cubic extension

Facade module. It re-exports the specification-side quotient model from
`CompPoly.Fields.Binary.BF64.Basic`, the reduction from `...Reduce`, the computable
`BitVec 64` carrier from `...Impl`, and the degree-three extension from `...Ext3`.
