# `GF(2^64)` in a polynomial basis

The field

```text
GF(2)[x] / (x^64 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
```

as a *flat* quotient by a single irreducible degree-64 polynomial, with an element
represented by the 64-bit word whose bit `i` is the coefficient of `x^i`. The modulus is
the standard low-weight pentanomial for this width, and its tail `x^4 + x^3 + x + 1`
(the constant `0x1B`) is what makes the reduction in `BF64/Reduce.lean` cheap.

This is a different presentation from the binary tower in
`CompPoly/Fields/Binary/Tower/`, which builds `GF(2^64)` as an iterated quadratic
extension. The two fields are abstractly isomorphic but use different bases, so their
bit-level encodings disagree: on the same bit patterns `2 * 3` is `6` here and `1` in the
tower's rung. Neither is a substitute for the other where the encoding is observable.

## Main definitions

* `basePoly` — the modulus, as a `Polynomial (ZMod 2)`. Specification only.
* `BF64Quot` — the field, as `AdjoinRoot basePoly`.
* `baseTail` — the modulus below its leading term, `x^4 + x^3 + x + 1`.

## Main statements

* `basePoly_irreducible` — irreducibility, by Rabin's test against the kernel-checked
  chains in `BF64.BaseCert`.
* `mul_pow_reduce` — the reduction identity `x^64 ≡ x^4 + x^3 + x + 1`.
* `card_bf64Quot` — `Fintype.card BF64Quot = 2 ^ 64`.

## Implementation notes

`basePoly` is `noncomputable` because Mathlib's `Polynomial` is a `Finsupp`, which has no
executable representation. It exists to state irreducibility and is never evaluated.
`CompPoly.Extension.ExtensionParams.poly` makes the same choice.

`BF64Quot` is the *quotient* presentation, used for cardinality and as the target of the
bridge. The computable presentation that arithmetic runs on is `BF64` in
`CompPoly/Fields/Binary/BF64/Impl.lean`, a `BitVec 64`; the two are related by
`BF64.toQuot`, which `BF64.toQuot_injective` and `BF64.toQuot_surjective` show is a
bijection.

`x^64 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1` is irreducible over `GF(2)`, by Rabin's test against the
kernel-checked chains in `BF64.BaseCert`.

Degree `64` has the single prime factor `2`, so the trace condition is joined by one
coprimality check, at exponent `2^32`. Note that the collapsed
`irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree` is *unsound* at this degree — it would accept a
product of equal-degree factors — so the general `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin` is
used, with `primeFactors_sixtyFour` supplying the prime factors of `64`.
