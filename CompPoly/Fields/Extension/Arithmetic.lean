# Computable arithmetic for monic quotient presentations

`ExtensionParams F` stores the degree, lower modulus coefficients and an explicit inverse-exponent
parameter `q`. `Ext P` is one nominal carrier with coefficient vectors in ascending degree order.
Its coordinate maps require no algebraic structure; arithmetic uses a ring of coefficients.
The presentation index separates parameter values for a fixed coefficient algebra. Operations
and their theorems are relative to the supplied ring or field structure on `F`; the raw carrier
does not separate alternative algebra structures on that same type. Distinct coefficient
presentations should use nominal coefficient types and explicit ring maps. The polynomial quotient
interpretation uses commutative coefficients; the raw formulas are defined for any ring.

Multiplication reduces monomials with `shiftReduce`. The executable reduction-table implementation
`mulTbl` is connected to `mul` by `mul_eq_mulTbl`. Power uses binary exponentiation, and the
canonical inverse candidate uses the literal exponent `q^d - 2`.

This module supplies no cardinality or irreducibility certificate. Polynomial specifications and
quotient correspondence belong to `Extension/Defs.lean` and `Extension/Bridge.lean`; certified field
laws belong to `Extension/Field.lean`. Raw parameters with an incorrect `q` still admit arithmetic
but do not thereby acquire field laws. The binomial conversion describes the modulus `X^d - W`.

namespace CompPoly.Extension

variable {F : Type*} [Ring F]

/--
The data defining an extension `F[X] / f` by a monic modulus `f` of degree `d`.

The modulus is stored by its `d` lower coefficients: `f = X^d + ∑_{i < d} lower[i] · X^i`. The
leading coefficient is an implicit `1`, so `f` is monic by construction.

Irreducibility is not part of these parameters: the quotient is a commutative ring for every
monic modulus over a commutative ring. Field laws additionally require finite-cardinality and
irreducibility certificates.

/-! ### Distinguished elements

`ofBase` places a coefficient-ring element in the constant coordinate, and `gen` has the
coordinates of `X`. The quotient bridge over a field promotes the constant embedding to an
`Algebra` structure and identifies the reduced power `gen ^ d` with `monomialMod d`.

def gen : Ext P := ofFn fun i => if (i : ℕ) = 1 then 1 else 0

/-! ### Operations

Multiplication is defined in terms of `shiftReduce` — the "multiply by `X`, reduce mod `f`"
map — whose iterates `monomialMod k = shiftReduce^[k] 1` are the reduced monomials `X^k mod f`.
Everything downstream is proved from the single homomorphism law
`toQuot (shiftReduce e) = rt * toQuot e`.

/--
Multiply by `X` and reduce modulo `f`.

`X · (∑ eᵢ Xⁱ) = ∑ eᵢ X^(i+1)`, whose top term `e_{d-1} X^d` wraps via `X^d = -∑ lowerₘ Xᵐ`.
So coefficient `m` of the reduced result is `e_{m-1} - e_{d-1} · lowerₘ`, with `e_{-1} = 0`.
This is the single linear map whose iterates build the reduction table `red`.

The monic-reduction product formula, representing multiplication in `F[X] / f`
when the coefficient ring is commutative.

Each product monomial `Xⁱ⁺ʲ` is reduced modulo `f` by `monomialMod (i + j)`, so coefficient `m`
of the product collects `xᵢ · yⱼ · [X^(i+j) mod f]ₘ` over all pairs `(i, j)`.

The reduction table: `red P` holds `X^k mod f` for every `k ≤ 2d - 2`, i.e. every exponent a
product of two reduced elements can reach.

Built by one `redScan` from `1`, so the whole table costs `O(d^2)`; `Vector.ofFn (monomialMod ·)`
would iterate `shiftReduce` from scratch for every entry, `O(d^3)` in all. It exists purely for
speed: `mul` is the specification, and `mulTbl` below is the compiled implementation that
consults this table.

Coefficient `k` of the unreduced product `x · y` in `F[X]`, the convolution `∑_{i + j = k} xᵢ yⱼ`,
as one loop over `i` with `j = k - i`; a pair outside `[0, d)` contributes zero. `k` ranges over
`[0, 2d - 1)`, the degrees a product of two reduced elements can reach.

Deliberately a separate function over its own `Mul` and `Add` instances, `@[noinline]` and
`@[nospecialize]`, and likewise `contractCoeff` below. Written inside `mulTbl`, or inlined or
specialised on the `Ring F` instance, `*` and `+` on `F` are re-derived from the ring dictionary
on every step of the innermost loop, through projections that allocate an intermediate structure
each time; the emitted C of the first loop run had `instDistribOfSemiring` in the loop body.
Here the two operations arrive as arguments, derived once per call of `mulTbl`, and the loop
only applies them. (`nospecialize` matters: instance arguments are specialised even without
`@[specialize]` on the callee.)

/--
Table-driven multiplication: the compiled implementation of `mul`.

Mathematically identical to `mul`, in two stages: the unreduced product `x · y` in `F[X]`,
`2d - 1` coefficients by `convCoeff`, then one contraction of those against the reduction table
`red` by `contractCoeff`. That is `d^2 + (2d - 1) d` coefficient multiplications where `mul`
performs `d^3`, and the reduced monomials come from the table instead of being re-derived by
`monomialMod` for every output coefficient. The sums are `Fin.foldl` loops rather than
`Finset.sum`, which compiles to list-building `Multiset` machinery.

`mul` remains the definition everything is proved about; `mul_eq_mulTbl` below swaps this in for
compilation via `@[csimp]`. The loops live in `convCoeff` and `contractCoeff`, for the reason
given there.

Specialised on `P` as well as on the instances: at a call site whose modulus is a constant, which
is every concrete extension field, the table `red P` is then a closed term the compiler
evaluates once, rather than being rebuilt on every multiplication.
