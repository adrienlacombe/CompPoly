## Contributing to CompPoly

We enthusiastically welcome contributions to CompPoly!

Whether you are fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new formalizations, your input is valuable. We particularly encourage contributions that address:

* **Repository handbook:** Contributors should usually start with [`README.md`](README.md), [`docs/wiki/README.md`](docs/wiki/README.md), and the module-level `README.md` files. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the AI-agent entrypoint and is mainly for agent-oriented tooling and workflow guardrails.
* **Active formalizations:** Please see the list of active formalization efforts and their blueprints.
* **Open Issues:** Please see the list of open issues for bugs, requested features, and specific formalization tasks. Issues tagged as `good first issue` or `help wanted` are great places to start.
* **Roadmap Goals:** We maintain a [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) outlining the planned direction and major goals for the library.
* **Documentation:** Please check [`README.md`](README.md), [`docs/wiki/README.md`](docs/wiki/README.md), and the module-level `README.md` files for current usage and structure notes, and feel free to propose improvements.

If you are interested in contributing but unsure where to begin, please get in touch.

### Large Contributions

For substantial contributions, such as a new proof system, we strongly encourage the development of a [blueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint) first.

* **What is a Blueprint?** A blueprint is a document that outlines:
    * The contents of the formalization.
    * The proposed formalization strategy in Lean (key definitions, theorems, assumptions).
    * A dependency graph relating all intermediate results to the final desired result.
    * References to relevant literature.
    * Potential challenges and design choices.
* **Why a Blueprint?** This helps align the contribution with the project's structure and goals *before* significant coding and proving effort is invested. It facilitates discussion and feedback from maintainers and the community. It also makes it easier to manage large efforts in a distributed way.
* **Process:** Please open a new discussion or issue to propose your planned contribution and discuss the blueprint before starting implementation.

## Performance Contributions

Making a fast implementation faster is a welcome contribution. The
full protocol is [`docs/wiki/autoresearch.md`](docs/wiki/autoresearch.md);
how the suite measures is [`docs/wiki/benchmarking.md`](docs/wiki/benchmarking.md);
the time to beat for every row is [`docs/wiki/benchmark-best-times.md`](docs/wiki/benchmark-best-times.md).

### Rules

* **Every function stays formally verified.** The specification definition does
  not change. A faster implementation is swapped in by `@[csimp]` with an
  equality theorem, or as a twin definition with an `_eq_` theorem that the call
  site depends on. Those are the two accepted shapes. `@[implemented_by]`
  substitutes code without a proof and is not accepted for this purpose, and
  `native_decide` is forbidden everywhere (see the TCB policy in
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)). `lake exe axiomsweep --check` must pass.
* **One change per PR.** A PR is one optimisation with one measured effect, so
  the verdict is attributable. Two independent ideas are two PRs.
* **The digest must not move.** Benchmark inputs are seeded per group, so a
  group's digest is the same across builds and commits. A `mismatch` verdict
  means the candidate computes something else; it is a bug, not a measurement.
* **Test, then measure, then prove.** The proof is the expensive part, so
  spend it last, on a change already shown correct on concrete inputs and
  faster in measurement. If the implementation you are optimising has no tests
  of its own under `tests/`, add them first, and make sure the original,
  formally verified function passes them before you change anything; they are
  then the test step of every iteration. If the proof later finds a bug the
  tests let through, add a test that targets that bug. While exploring, the refinement theorem
  may carry a `sorry` so the new code is what gets tested and timed; a PR never
  contains one, and `lake exe axiomsweep --check` is how you confirm that.
* **`lake test` is part of the gate, not just `lake build`.** An implementation
  whose tests take hours to elaborate is not faster: inlining attributes on
  loop-shaped bodies have done exactly that here.
* **Write the proof so the next optimisation does not break it.** State the
  implementation's coefficient and unfolding facts as named lemmas marked
  `@[simp]` or `@[grind =]`, and close the refinement theorem with `simp only [...]` over
  them or with `grind`, rather than a hand-written `rw` chain. The next change
  to the implementation then updates lemmas, not proof steps. See "Proving so the proof
  survives the next iteration" in `docs/wiki/autoresearch.md`.
* **Quote ratios, not nanoseconds.** Numbers from your machine are not
  comparable with the tables in `benchmark-best-times.md`, which are taken on
  one reference machine. Report the A/B verdict and the candidate-over-baseline
  ratio per row. A maintainer re-measures on the reference machine after merge
  and updates the tables and the pass log; do not edit them in your PR.
* **Keep the harness out of it.** A PR that changes `bench/` and a fast
  implementation at once cannot be judged, since both sides of the comparison
  moved. If a new benchmark group is needed, add it first in its own PR,
  following "Adding a benchmark" in `docs/wiki/benchmarking.md`.

### Running the benchmarks

```bash
lake build CompPolyBenchLib CompPolyBench           # `lake build` alone does not build bench/
lake exe CompPolyBench --list                        # every group key
lake exe CompPolyBench --medium --validate-only --groups <key>   # correctness only, no timings
lake exe CompPolyBench --medium --groups <key>       # timed; output under bench/out/
```

`--medium` is the preset CI, the A/B loop and the best-times tables use.
Results, a Markdown report and a manifest land in `bench/out/`, which is
ignored by git. Read the `Spread` column before the number: an `n=1` row
carries no dispersion and no ratio should be read off it.

### Running the loop

```bash
./scripts/bench-ab.sh freeze                 # build the baseline binary from the current tree
# edit the fast implementation (a `sorry` on its refinement theorem is fine here)
lake build && lake test                      # test: the implementation's tests and the digest gate
./scripts/bench-ab.sh run <key>[,<key>...]   # measure: both binaries turn about, then --compare
# on `faster` without SUSPECT: prove the refinement theorem, then
lake build && lake test && lake exe axiomsweep --check
```

Freeze from `main` before editing. `run` builds the candidate once, runs the
two binaries alternately, appends the harness groups so machine drift is
measured alongside, and prints the comparison; a copy lands in
`bench/out/ab/<run>/compare-*.md`. A row is `faster` only when the ratio of
medians clears the threshold (5% by default) and every candidate invocation
beat every baseline invocation. Keep on `faster` without `SUSPECT` and with
harness drift inside ±10%; revert otherwise, and repeat rather than read a run
whose drift is outside that band. Use a quiet machine, and do not rebuild or
edit `bench/` while a run is in flight.

### What the PR must contain

* Title `perf(<scope>): <subject>`.
* The change in one paragraph: what was slow, why, what the new code does.
* The proof: the `@[csimp]` or `_eq_` theorem that ties the new code to the
  specification, named in the description, and closed over the implementation's
  lemma set rather than by a rewrite chain.
* The tests: the concrete-input tests for the implementation, added in this PR
  if it had none.
* The A/B evidence: the `compare-*.md` table or its relevant rows, with the
  preset, rounds, and the drift line. A `same` or `slower` verdict that is kept
  for another reason (a compile-time fix, a correctness repair) says so.
* Confirmation that `lake build`, `lake test`, `--validate-only` on the affected
  groups and `lake exe axiomsweep --check` pass.

## New Types Owe a Codec

A new field carrier or polynomial representation is a protocol type the moment
ArkLib can name it, so it ships with its serialization in the same PR. The
formats and the invariants they keep are in
[`docs/wiki/serialization.md`](docs/wiki/serialization.md); its "Adding an
instance" section is the recipe. What the PR must contain:

* The codec. A fixed-width scalar (a prime-field carrier, a binary field) gets
  `CanonicalNat` and `ByteCodec := ByteCodec.ofCanonicalNat _`. A fixed-length
  composite (an extension, a dense coefficient vector) gets `ByteCodec` by
  concatenation, usually through `ByteCodec.instVector`. A variable-length
  type gets `DelimitedCodec`, built from the list, pair, and vector codecs with
  `Valid` stating what fits the `u64` framing.
* The theorems through the class interfaces, not only the raw functions:
  `deserialize (serialize x) = some x` and injectivity, which the derived
  instances give for free once the codec's one law is proved, plus the total
  decoder's round trip for a scalar (`CanonicalNat.deserialize_serialize`).
* For a fast carrier of an existing field, the agreement lemma with the spec
  field, `toBytes (ofField x) = toBytes x`, and a test that the stored word is
  not what gets emitted. This is the correctness statement of the instance, and
  it is what keeps the bytes carrier-independent.
* A `Bytes.lean` test module mirroring the source module: a known byte vector,
  a round trip through `serialize`/`deserialize`, and one rejected input.
* A `Repr` instance if the type has none. It is not part of the byte format, but
  a type that can be written out should also be printable.

Do not add `ToJson`/`FromJson` or another ad hoc encoding alongside; JSON, when
a consumer asks for it, will be hex strings of these same bytes.

## Pull Request Guidelines

We follow the specific convention for pull request titles and descriptions used by the Lean community.

### Title Format
The title should follow the format:
```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:**
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `doc`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
* `refactor`: Code refactoring
* `test`: Adding missing tests
* `chore`: Maintenance
* `perf`: Performance improvements
* `ci`: CI workflow changes

**Subject:**
* Use imperative, present tense ("change" not "changed" or "changes").
* Do not capitalize the first letter.
* No dot (.) at the end.

### Description
The description should include:
* Motivation for the change.
* Contrast with previous behavior.
* References to issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
* If the PR changes commands, repo structure, generated outputs, or recurring contributor guidance, update the matching page in [`docs/wiki/`](docs/wiki/README.md) in the same PR.

## Style and Naming Guidelines
We aim to adhere to the [Lean community's contribution guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/tree/lean4/templates/contribute).
Our [linting script](scripts/lint-style.sh) helps enforce some aspects of these guidelines.

### Naming Conventions

* **Files**: `UpperCamelCase.lean` (e.g., `BinarySearch.lean`).
* **Types and Structures**: `UpperCamelCase` (e.g., `MonoidHom`, `Visualizer`).
* **Functions and Terms**: `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `binarySearch`, `isPrime`).
* **Theorems and Proofs**: `snake_case` (e.g., `add_comm`, `list_reverse_id`).
* **Acronyms**: Treat as words (e.g., `HtmlParser` not `HTMLParser`).
* **Prop-valued Classes**: Use `UpperCamelCase`. If the class is an adjective, use the `Is` prefix (e.g., `IsCompact`, `IsPrime`). If it is a noun, no prefix is needed (e.g., `Group`, `TopologicalSpace`).
* **Spelling**: Use American English for declaration names (e.g., `analyze` not `analyse`, `color` not `colour`).
* **Dot Notation**: Use namespaces to group related definitions (e.g., `List.map`). This enables dot notation (e.g., `l.map f`) when the type is known. Use manual dot notation for logical connectives and equality (e.g., `And.intro`, `Eq.refl`, `Iff.mp`). *Preferred but not enforced — the merged codebase uses both `h.symm` and `Eq.symm h` forms freely; flag only when truly ambiguous.*
* **Axiomatic Names**: Use standard names for properties: `refl`, `symm`, `trans`, `comm`, `assoc`, `inj` (injective), `congr`.
* **Identifiers**: 
    * Use namespaces for logical properties (e.g., `And.comm`, `Or.intro`).
    * Use descriptive names for arithmetic/algebraic properties (e.g., `mul_comm`, `add_assoc`).

### Theorem Naming Logic

* **Hypotheses**: Use `_of_` to separate hypotheses, listed in the order they appear (e.g., `lt_of_succ_le` means "less than *follows from* successor less equal").
* **Variants**: Use `left` or `right` to describe which argument changes or is relevant (e.g., `add_le_add_left`).
* **Structural Lemmas**:
    * `ext`: For extensionality (`∀ x, f x = g x → f = g`).
    * `iff`: For bidirectional implications.
    * `inj` / `injective`: For injectivity results.
    * `mono` / `antitone`: For monotonicity.
* **Induction/Recursion**:
    * `induction_on` / `recOn`: Use when the value comes before the constructions (motive eliminates to Prop / Type).
    * `induction` / `rec`: Use when the constructions come before the value.
* **Predicates**: Generally use prefixes (e.g., `isClosed_Icc` not `Icc_isClosed`). Exceptions include property suffixes like `_inj`, `_mono`, `_injective`, `_surjective`.

### Module Layout

* **Theorem-only helper modules**: Prefer `Lemmas` for new theorem-only leaf modules.
* **Proof placement**: Keep transport and equivalence lemmas near the bridge layer (`ToPoly`, `MvPolyEquiv`, etc.), but keep the first user-facing correctness theorem next to the definition it justifies. For example, bridge lemmas like those in `CompPoly/Univariate/ToPoly/Core.lean` and `CompPoly/Multivariate/MvPolyEquiv/Eval.lean` stay with the bridge, while a theorem like `eval_interpolatePow_at_node` stays with `interpolatePow` in `CompPoly/Univariate/Lagrange.lean`.

### Variable Conventions

We follow Mathlib style, adapted for algebraic code. The conventions below
reflect actual usage across the repository (`Univariate/`, `Multivariate/`,
`Multilinear/`, `Bivariate/`, `Fields/`); please consult adjacent files when
in doubt.

* `u`, `v`, `w`, ...           : Universes
* `α`, `β`, `γ`, ...            : Generic types (in non-algebraic contexts)
* `R`, `M`, `G`, `F`, ...       : Algebraic carrier types (rings, modules,
  groups, fields) — preferred over `α`, `β` in algebraic declarations such
  as `variable {R : Type*} [Semiring R]`
* `a`, `b`, `c`, ...            : Propositions
* `x`, `y`, `z`, ...            : Elements of a generic type
* `h`, `h₁`, ...                : Assumptions / hypotheses
* `p`, `q`                     : Polynomials or predicates (disambiguate by
  type and surrounding context — in this repo `p`, `q` are most often
  `CPolynomial`, `CMvPolynomial`, or `CMlPolynomial` values)
* `m`, `n`, `k`, ...            : Natural numbers
* `i`, `j`, `k`, ...            : Indices into vectors, lists, or `Fin n`
  (these may be `ℕ`- or `ℤ`-valued; the convention is about the indexing
  role, not the underlying type)
* `s`, `t`, ...                : Sets or lists

### Symbol Naming Dictionary

When translating theorem statements into names, we use standard mappings for symbols:

**Logic**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `∨` | `or` | `∧` | `and` | `¬` | `not` |
| `→` | `of` / `imp` | `↔` | `iff` | `∃` | `exists` |
| `∀` | `all` / `forall` | `=` | `eq` | `≠` | `ne` |

**Sets and Lattices**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `∈` | `mem` | `∉` | `notMem` | `⊆` | `subset` |
| `∩` | `inter` | `∪` | `union` | `\` | `sdiff` |
| `≤` | `le` | `<` | `lt` | `⊥` | `bot` |
| `⊤` | `top` | `⊔` | `sup` | `⊓` | `inf` |

**Algebra**
| Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name | Symbol | Name |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+` | `add` | `*` | `mul` | `^` | `pow` |
| `-` | `neg` / `sub` | `⁻¹`| `inv` | `/` | `div` |
| `∑` | `sum` | `∏` | `prod` | `•` | `smul` |

> **Note**: In adherence with mathlib, we standardize on `≤` (`le`) and `<` (`lt`). Avoid `≥` (`ge`) and `>` (`gt`) in theorem statements unless necessary for argument ordering.

### Syntax and Formatting

* **Line Length**: Keep `.lean` source lines under 100 characters. (Markdown and CI / workflow files are not subject to this rule — the enforced linter at `scripts/lint-style.py` only processes `.lean` files.)
* **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* **Headers**: Use standard file headers including copyright, license (Apache 2.0), and authors.
  ```lean
  /-
  Copyright (c) 2024 Author Name. All rights reserved.
  Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.
  Authors: Author Name
  -/
  ```
* **Imports**: Group imports at the top of the file.
* **Operators**: Put spaces on both sides of `:`, `:=`, and infix operators. Place them before a line break rather than at the start of the next line.
* **Hypotheses**: Prefer placing hypotheses to the left of the colon (e.g., `(h : P) : Q`) rather than using arrows (`: P → Q`) when the proof introduces them.
* **Functions**: Prefer `fun x ↦ ...` over `λ x, ...`.
* **Instances**: Use the `where` syntax for defining instances and structures. *Preferred but not enforced — the merged codebase uses both `instance ... := ⟨...⟩` and `instance ... where` forms freely.*
* **Binders**: Use a space after binders (e.g., `∀ x,` not `∀x,`).
* **Tactic Mode**: Place `by` at the end of the line preceding the tactic block. Indent the tactic block.
* **Calculations**: In `calc` blocks, align relations.
* **Empty Lines**: Avoid empty lines *inside* definitions or proofs.
* **Delimiters**: Avoid parentheses where possible. Use `<|` (pipe left) and `|>` (pipe right) to reduce nesting. Avoid using `;` to separate tactics unless writing short, single-line tactic sequences. *The `<|` / `|>` preference is preferred but not enforced — the merged codebase uses both styles freely. The `;` guidance still applies.*
* **Error Messages**: In custom error or trace messages, surround interpolated data with backticks (inline) or place it on a new indented line.

### Normal Forms

We aim for consistent representations of equivalent statements:
* **Standard Forms**: Use established normal forms (e.g., `s.Nonempty` instead of `s ≠ ∅`) to enable dot notation and consistency.
* **Inequalities with Bottom/Top**:
    * In **assumptions**, use `x ≠ ⊥` (easier to check).
    * In **conclusions**, use `⊥ < x` (more powerful result).
    * Similarly for top: `x ≠ ⊤` in assumptions, `x < ⊤` in conclusions.

### Tactic Mode & Performance

* **Squeezing Simp**: Do not "squeeze" terminal `simp` calls (replacing `simp` with `simp only [...]`) unless necessary for performance or stability. Un-squeezed `simp` is often more readable and robust to minor library changes.
* **Comments**: Use `--` for inline comments and `/- ... -/` for block comments.

### Transparency and API Design

* **Definitions (`def`)**: By default, `def` creates `semireducible` definitions. These are usually not unfolded by tactics like `rw` and `simp` without explicit instruction. This is preferred for most definitions to keep terms manageable.
* **Abbreviations (`abbrev`)**: Creates `reducible` definitions that are always unfolded. Use this for type synonyms or lightweight aliases where the underlying term should be exposed.
* **Irreducible**: Use `irreducible` (or `structure` wrappers) to seal API boundaries when the internal implementation details should not leak.

### Deprecation Policy

* **Renaming**: If you rename a declaration, please ensure you fix any breakage this causes. If that is not possible, keep the old name as a deprecated alias to avoid breaking downstream code immediately.
  ```lean
  @[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")] alias oldName := newName
  ```
* **Removal**: For removals, provide a message explaining the transition.
  ```lean
  @[deprecated "Use `better_theorem` instead" (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")]
  theorem old_theorem ...
  ```

### Documentation Standards

Every definition and major theorem should have a docstring.

* **Module Docstrings**: Each file should start with a `/-! ... -/` block containing a title, summary, notation, and references.
* **Sectioning Comments**: Use `/-! ### Title -/` to structure large files into sections. These appear in the generated documentation.
* **Declaration Docstrings**: Use `/-- ... -/` above definitions.
* **Syntax**:
    * Use backticks for Lean names: `` `List.map` ``.
    * Use LaTeX for math: `$ f(x) = y $` (inline) or `$$ \sum_{i=0}^n i $$` (display).
* **Tactic Documentation**: Complete and self-contained descriptions for tactics.

### Citation Standards

When referencing papers in Lean docstrings:

* **Use citation keys in text**: Reference papers with citation keys like `[ACFY24]` rather than full titles or URLs.

* **Include a References section**: Each file that cites papers should have a `## References` section in its docstring header:
  ```lean
  ## References
  
  * [Arnon, G., Chiesa, A., Fenzi, G., and Yogev, E., *WHIR: Reed–Solomon Proximity Testing
      with Super-Fast Verification*][ACFY24]
  * [Ben-Sasson, E., Carmon, D., Ishai, Y., Kopparty, S., and Saraf, S., *Proximity Gaps
      for Reed-Solomon Codes*][BCIKS20]
  ```
  Format: `* [Author Last Name, First Initial, *Title*][citation_key]`.

* **Add BibTeX entries**: All academic papers must have entries in [`blueprint/src/references.bib`](blueprint/src/references.bib). When adding a new paper, add the BibTeX entry, use the citation key in your Lean file, and list it in the References section. That file is currently a standalone bibliography — there is no rendered leanblueprint project yet — and its header records the `grep` that lists cited-but-missing keys.

* **Non-academic references**: Implementation references (GitHub repos, specifications) may include URLs directly and typically don't need BibTeX entries.
