# A/B Verdicts

Judges a candidate build against a baseline build from the results files each
wrote, one file per invocation. The unit of evidence is the **invocation-level
median**: samples within one process are not independent of each other, so the
`K` medians from `K` separate processes are what the comparison reasons about.

A row is `faster` only when two things hold at once: the ratio of medians clears
a practical-importance threshold, *and* every candidate invocation beat every
baseline invocation. Strict separation of two groups of five happens by chance
one time in `C(10, 5) = 252`; the threshold keeps a real but negligible change
from being reported as a win. `slower` is the mirror image, and everything else
is `same`.

Two checks come for free from the harness. Inputs are seeded per group, so the
strong digest of a row is the same across binaries and commits; a candidate whose
digest differs from the baseline computed something else, and the row is a
`mismatch` rather than a measurement. And a candidate that is implausibly fast
with an unchanged digest is flagged `suspect`, the signature of a body the
compiler folded away (`docs/bench-audit-2026.md` §12.6 and §12.7).
