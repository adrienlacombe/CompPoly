# Base-field arithmetic benchmarks

`mul`, `add`, `inv` and `pow` over the four small prime fields a STARK prover
spends its time in — KoalaBear, BabyBear, Mersenne31 and Goldilocks — and
`mul` over the three eight-limb pairing scalar fields, BN254, BLS12-381 and
BLS12-377. Each group runs the canonical `ZMod` implementation beside the
verified native-word one on the same inputs, so the group digest cross-checks
the two.

## Why these are chains

A field multiplication is one or two nanoseconds and the harness's own
per-iteration cost is about 1.8 ns, so a row that performs the operation once
per timed iteration reports the harness. Every row here instead performs the
operation `chainRounds` times per iteration and divides by `workUnits`; see
`CompPolyBench.Harness.Chain` for why the chain touches no array and allocates
nothing.

The chain is seeded from an operand pool indexed by the iteration counter. That
costs one boxed array read per `chainRounds` operations — under a tenth of a
percent — and buys two things: the body genuinely depends on `i`, so it is
neither cached as a closed term nor hoisted out of the sample loop, and the
untimed digest sees a whole pool of inputs rather than one.

## Scaffolding other field groups share

`ChainRep`, `chainLatencyRow`, `chainThroughputRow`, `runBinOpGroup` and
`runUnOpGroup` are the chained-group scaffolding, and are used from the binary
tower groups as well. They live here rather than beside `Harness/Chain.lean`
because they need `runTimedSpec`, which `Harness/Chain.lean` deliberately does
not import.

## Latency and throughput

Reported separately, as Plonky3's `benchmark_mul_latency` and
`benchmark_mul_throughput` are, because they are different numbers and a prover
is bounded by different ones in different places. The latency row chains the
operation against a fixed operand, so each step waits on the last. The
throughput row runs ten independent accumulators, so the pipeline can overlap
them. `mul` and `add` carry both; `inv` and `pow` carry latency only, matching
the peer, and use a shorter chain because one operation already costs tens of
multiplications.

/-- Operand-pool size for the chained field benchmarks, and so their digest length. -/
def fieldPoolSize : Nat := 64

/-- Rounds in an inversion or exponentiation chain.

One `unrollBlock`, twenty times shorter than `chainRounds`, because a single
inversion is tens of multiplications and the canonical `ZMod` row is three
orders of magnitude slower again. Still long enough that the harness floor is
under a thousandth of the row. -/
def expChainRounds : Nat := unrollBlock

/-- Latency-chain depth for the eight-limb scalar fields.

A quarter of `chainRounds`: a 256-bit Montgomery multiply is an order of
magnitude more than a 32-bit one and the canonical row three further orders,
so the full depth would put a single iteration past the sample budget. Chosen
to be both a whole number of `unrollBlock`s and `throughputWidth` times a whole
number of `throughputUnroll`s, so the latency and throughput rows of a group
agree on `workUnits` — which the group check enforces. -/
def heavyChainRounds : Nat := 5 * unrollBlock

/-- Throughput-chain depth pairing with `heavyChainRounds`. -/
def heavyThroughputRounds : Nat := 8 * throughputUnroll

/-- Exponent used by the `pow` benchmarks.

A 31-bit exponent of Hamming weight 16, so the binary ladder performs 30
squarings and 15 multiplications on every field. The same exponent everywhere,
so the fields are comparable; nothing about it is field-specific. -/
def powExponent : Nat := 0x5A5A5A5A

/-- One representation of a field, as a chained benchmark row needs it.

The operation itself is deliberately *not* a field of this structure. It is
passed as a direct argument to the `@[specialize]` runners below, so the
compiler sees a known function at the chain's call site; through a structure
field it would be an indirect call per operation, which for a one-nanosecond
multiply is the whole measurement. -/

/-! ## The four fields

Each field contributes a pair of `ChainRep`s drawn from one operand pool, so
the canonical and native-word rows of every group see the same inputs. The
group runners below are written out one per operation rather than generated,
because the operation has to reach `chainLatency` as a statically known
function: routed through a closure it becomes an indirect call per operation,
which for these fields is more than the operation. -/
