# A/B Comparison Command

`--compare` reads the results files two builds wrote and judges the candidate
against the baseline. It measures nothing itself; the driver
`scripts/bench-ab.sh` produces the files by running the two binaries turn about.

Exit codes: `0` when every row was judged, whatever the verdicts; `1` when
nothing could be compared (a path that does not exist, a malformed file, sides
measured under different presets); `3` when at least one row is a `mismatch` or
`missing`, which means the candidate changed what a row computes or which rows
exist, and the loop must stop and look rather than read a ratio.
