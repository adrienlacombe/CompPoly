# Multiplicative NTT benchmarks

The forward and inverse transforms on their own, swept over size, rather than
buried inside a multiplication. `docs/bench-audit-2026.md` §13 names the multiplicative
NTT as one of the operations to measure against Plonky3, and until now the only
way to see it here was as one term of `univariate-mul-*`.

Two implementations per direction, cross-checked by the group digest:

* the reference radix-2 transform, `NTT.Forward.forwardImpl` and
  `NTT.Inverse.inverseImpl`;
* the planned radix-4 transform, `NTTFast.Plan.forwardImpl` and
  `NTTFast.Plan.inverseImpl`, over a `Plan` built outside the timed closure.

Every body reads its input from a two-entry pool indexed by the iteration
counter. That is not decoration. The first version of this file precomputed
`spectrum` with the very expression the forward reference row then timed, and
the compiler recognised the two as the same: the row reported 6 ns for a
`2 ^ 12` transform and 1.6 million iterations per sample, at every size
identically. A body that varies with `i` can be neither shared with a value
computed outside the loop nor hoisted out of it.

`workUnits` is `n / 2 * log n`, the radix-2 butterfly count. It is a property
of the *problem*, not of the implementation: giving the radix-4 row its own
smaller count would divide away exactly the algorithmic advantage the group
exists to show.

## Bit reversal, and where it is allowed to appear

`Plan.forwardImpl` returns its output bit-reversed relative to the reference
(`NTTFast/Correctness/Pipeline.lean:29`), and `Plan.inverseImpl` expects its
input that way. Neither permutation may enter the timed region: an
`Array.ofFn` of size `n` inside the body would make the fast row look slower,
a failure in the direction that reads as an honest result.

So the forward group puts the permutation in the planned row's **checksum**,
which `runTimedSpec` uses only in the untimed pass, and gives that row an
explicit `sink` so the default does not drag the permuting checksum into the
measurement. The inverse group instead permutes the planned row's **input**
once, before timing.

The permutation is defined here rather than imported from
`NTT.Transform.bitRevPermute`, because the reference forward transform is
built from that same function: importing it would let a single wrong
`bitRevNat` produce two compensating errors and a group that agrees on a wrong
digest.

/-- Largest size at which the reference transform still earns a row.

The reference radix-2 transform costs about 100 ns per butterfly against the
plan's 3.5 ns, so one reference inverse is 2.6 ms at `2 ^ 12` and 53 ms at
`2 ^ 16` — past the sample budget, and the suite's own guidance is that no
ratio may be read off an `n = 1` row. Above this the groups carry the planned
rows alone, and the cross-check lives at the sizes below. -/
