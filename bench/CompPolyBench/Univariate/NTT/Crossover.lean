# Schoolbook / NTT crossover

Where NTT-based multiplication starts to beat the schoolbook product. A sweep
of operand sizes, schoolbook against the planned NTT pipeline, over KoalaBear's
native-word representation.

This replaces `tests/CompPolyTests/Univariate/NTT/Benchmark.lean`, which held
the only crossover logic in the repo, ran nothing under `lake test`, was
imported by nothing, and printed its results through `#eval`.
`docs/bench-audit-2026.md` recorded it as "the specification for a future crossover
metric"; this is that metric, so the file goes.

One group per operand size, because `workUnits` — the operand coefficient
count — must agree across a group, and the whole point of the sweep is that it
does not agree across sizes. The domain for each size is the smallest that
holds the convolution length `2k - 1`, and the plan is built outside the timed
closure, as a caller would.
