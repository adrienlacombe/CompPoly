# `GF(2^64)` and `GF(2^192)` regression tests

Differential vectors for the polynomial-basis `GF(2^64)` of
`CompPoly/Fields/Binary/BF64/` and its cubic extension, plus guards that the definitions
are not degenerate.

The vectors are independently produced reference values for this modulus and basis. They
are what distinguishes a correct port from a plausible one: a wrong modulus, a wrong
reduction constant, or a wrong extension coefficient vector all compile cleanly and
silently give a *different* field, but fail these.

Base-field vectors are checked with `decide +kernel`, so the kernel evaluates the
carry-less product and the reduction. Extension vectors use `#guard`, which runs the
*compiled* arithmetic at elaboration time, following `CompPolyTests.Fields.Extension`:
that is deliberate, since a `Field` instance that regressed to noncomputable would fail
the build rather than pass silently.
